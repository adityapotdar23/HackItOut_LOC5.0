In India, the offline verification and document submission processes for any official document can be lengthy, difficult, and paper-intensive. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, ranging from frustration to anxiety to relief, and it can feel like you're jumping through hoops just to be recognized as a valid citizen, as individuals must typically visit government offices in person to submit their documents and then wait a long time for verification and approval. For instance, a passport renewal typically requires the submission of hard copies of various documents, including identification cards, proofs of address, and certificates, which must be verified by government officials and can take several weeks or even months, depending on the volume of applications and the efficiency of the government office. 

Creating a digital identity provides security, convenience, privacy, and personalization to the
citizens and eases the process of offline verification.

We developed a collaborative approach to classify different proofs, images, and documents into multiple predefined categories using an ML model and create a digital identity of a citizen. 

Here are some points which the software contains - 

Identity creation and verification: The algorithm is used to create and verify the identity of an individual by comparing the personal information provided against various authentication factors using government-issued identification documents.

Fraud detection: The algorithm can be used to detect and prevent fraud in the process of creating a digital identity.

Risk assessment. The algorithm can be used to assess the risk associated with an Individual's digital identity, such as the likelihood of identity theft or fraudulent activity.
